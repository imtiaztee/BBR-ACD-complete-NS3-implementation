This repository has been created for experimenting the BBR-ACD scheme proposed in 
"BBR-ACD: BBR with Advanced Congestion Detection".
***The article has been submitted for review in IEEE Access.***

The BBR-ACD has been implemented on modified version of Jain et al.'s BBR implementation.

You can find modified version of Jain et al.'s BBR implementation in:
/src/internet/model/tcp-bbr.cc
/src/internet/model/tcp-bbr.h

And you can find BBR-ACD implementation in:
/src/internet/model/tcp-bbr-acd.cc
/src/internet/model/tcp-bbr-acd.h

For experimenting, follow the following steps:
Step 1: Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/imtiaztee/EE-Hello-Adaptive-Hello-Interval-for-FANETs

Step 2: Configure and build the cloned repo:
./waf configure
./waf

Step 3: Put your scenario in the scratch and run, 
        You can test the BBR-ACD by implementing "TcpBbrAcd" as transport layer protocol into your scenario.
